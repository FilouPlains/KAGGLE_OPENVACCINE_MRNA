## ü§î Context

> This project is actually trying to answer to this Kaggle project: [**OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-covid-vaccine).

The main problematic is the synthesis of a stable mRNA vaccine. Because of the molecular nature of it, the vaccine degraded itself easily and quickly. To counter that, it is necessary to synthesize a mRNA stable.

To do so, the product mRNA have to be tested. And this is where this project take place: creating a neural network to predict the stability of a given sequence.

## üßê Methods Implemented

Because this project is done to validate a course, one mandatory criterion is create two neural network approches. Here, we've done:
- A "simple" neural network.
- A method using embedding.
